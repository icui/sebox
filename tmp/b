We present a source encoding method that significantly increases the speed of adjoint waveform tomography. The method enables the kernels to be computed with only one forward and one adjoint simulation regardless of the number of sources or receivers. In the meantime, it perfectly eliminates crosstalk noise between different sources and does not require each source to be received by all receivers. This is achieved by assigning each source with a unique frequency and measuring only the stationary part of the seismograms. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through 3D regional synthetic experiments. The experiment region has a span of 120 degrees covering part of North America, Asia, and Europe. 988,152 traces from 786 earthquakes and 9,825 stations are selected. Through ~20 inversions each containing 30 iterations, we have shown that the kernels computed using this method are good enough to ensure a steady decrease of model misfit and also determined the best choice of the objective function, preconditioner, and optimization method.
