We present a source encoding method that significantly increases the speed of adjoint waveform tomography. The technique enables the kernels to be computed with only one forward and one adjoint simulation regardless of the number of sources or receivers. In the meantime, it perfectly eliminates crosstalk noise between different sources and does not require each source to be received by all receivers. This is accomplished by assigning each source a unique frequency and measuring only the stationary part of the seismograms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through 3D regional synthetic experiments. The region of interest covers parts of North America, Asia, and Europe. We selected 988,152 traces from 786 earthquakes recorded at 9,825 stations. Based on ~20 inversions, each containing 30 iterations, we show that the kernels computed using this method are good enough to ensure a steady decrease of model misfit and determine the best choice of the objective function, preconditioner, and optimization method.
